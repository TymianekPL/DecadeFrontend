            The Setup section is currently under development. We are working diligently to provide comprehensive
            instructions on how to configure and get started with Decade. This will include detailed steps to install
            and set up the runtime environment, as well as guidance on integrating Decade with your projects. Please
            check back soon for updates. Mrrrrp, thank you for your patience! 🐾😺
